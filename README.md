# Refresh

Refresh is a Kotlin based Digital Wellbeing application for tracking apps usage.

## Requirements

Android Studio is the main requirement in running Refresh.
Running the app can be done in two ways, on a physical Android device or using an Emulator provided by Android Studio.
If running the app on a physical device, a USB cable is required.
Additionally, Minimum Android required for running is Lollipop version 5.1 (API level 22).

## Running refresh on an Android device

First, go into the device's Settings>About phone>Software information. Here, tap on the Build number 7 times, or until a message is displayed saying you are already a developer. 
Next, go to Settings>Developer options>Debugging and enable USB debugging.
Finally, open the application with Android Studio and connect the device to the computer with the USB cable. The device name should show up next to the Run button in Android Studio. Click run and wait a few minutes for the installation to be complete. 

## Using Refresh

Refresh is very easy to use. Upon first run, the app will ask for permission to access data usage. Pressing on "App Settings" will directly take the user to the necessary settings, where they must scroll to find the app, tap on it and enable the permission. Without this permission, usage tracking feature does not work. To add apps to monitor, press the floating purple button and select the apps you want from the list of all installed applications. Pressing the "check" icon confirms the selection. The total usage for the selected applications on the on-going day is displayed along with a pie chart. If apps have 0 usage, the app chart won't show. To see an individual app's usage, tap on the App. This will open a new screen with detailed daily and weekly usage. There is also a countdown timer on this screen, which can be set and run, but does not have a purpose. The timer is only illustrative of the future intention to implement app limits. Press the back arrow to return to the Summary screen. Finally, to see suggestive articles about Digital Wellbeing, tap on the bottom bar "Explore" option. To read the full article, tap on it. This will open the device's web browser to the article.
